##My COM port is COM5

import serial

ser = serial.Serial("COM5", 19200, timeout=1) ##open the serial port (COM port, baud rate, timeout)
cmd = input("Command:") ##type an ASCII command to send, hit enter to send over the line.
ser.write((cmd+"\r").encode("ASCII")) ##writes command entered into previous line's input with a carriage return at the end, encoded as ASCII
print(ser.read(64)) ##prints 64 bytes from the response prompted by the command
ser.close() ##closes the COM port immediately
